# About Me

My name is Gaming Alex 553. I'm a C++ student, thinking of switching to Java, and a Minecraft player. 
I recovered this account after 2 years, since I lost access to it, right when the hope that I would recover these accounts was gone.
So my goal on this site is to learn new things and teach others. So I appreciate any support offered.
